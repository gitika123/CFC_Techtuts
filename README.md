# CFC_chatbot
This   project   is  done by our team Techtuts ,to   implement  chatbot  that would  help  flood  victims  in  those  tough  situations . In our  project  we  have  prepared  a  chatbot  using  IBM  Watson  services .It   works  as   an  interface  between   the  victims  and  the  officials. Whenever  the  victim want  the  help, he  can   just   keep  a  message  so  the  chatbot  can  help  them.<br><br>
Visit our website to view the chatbot:https://gitika123.github.io/CFC_Techtuts/index1.html<br><br>
For  example , when the   victim  is in  need  of   food   he would  just   ask the  chatbot  about  food so  that  it  displays   a   Tollfree  number  which  will  help  to contact  to the  officials .
